<h1>Ones Who Complete Themselves<a class="headerlink" href="#ones-who-complete-themselves" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>On one occasion, the author has the opportunity to visit the city Weimar
where Goethe the poet lived. Probably in one of his visits to many
places, the author read a sentence that intrigued him. It said that
Goethe was “a poet who completed himself.” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id77" id="id1">1</a></p>
<p>The process of self-completion, the author believes, is a process in
which artists, scientists, crafts-persons, martial artist, and spiritual
practitioners, among others, are accustomed to. Goethe was a statesman,
a scientist, and a poet. He must have been <em>completing</em> himself both
in his craft as well as a person.</p>
<p>Intuitively, we might experience this longing for self-completion.
However, wherefore is this longing? There many answers to that question.
However, the author thinks that one of the motivations for
self-completion is so humans may face the sorrow and hardships in life.</p>
<p>The quest for perfection in virtue is a self-fulfilling journey. It is
virtuous in itself. The professions mentioned before require that one
trains oneself to obtain skills and practical knowledge. One may obtain
these by preparatory study, but the most fruitful way to achieve it is
through often practical experience. Even in the context of a spiritual
search, some spiritual traditions used the
term <em>training</em> and <em>practice</em> as its path to enlightenment.</p>
<p>Let us follow the trail of this muse, and see how we can connect the
search for self-completion, as a whole, to art, especially in the realm
of poetry. Let us start from the beginning, from our intuitive longing
for self-completion.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-longing-for-self-completion">
<h2>The Longing for Self Completion<a class="headerlink" href="#the-longing-for-self-completion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Suffering is a noble truth, said Buddha, and, therefore,
unavoidable. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id78" id="id2">2</a> To live as a human is to experience sorrow in various
forms. If it is unavoidable, then it is the best thing to do that trains
and prepares for the worst.</p>
<p>However, by training oneself, human makes their progress: it survives
the hardships and grows. Like a farmer who prepares for winter, those
with the best tool and knowledge would be able to prepare better.
Self-completion is the human effort to prepare their tool in facing
life’s suffering. A completed craftsman is skillful in completing the
challenge of the task that comes. When one is ready, one answers in the
best way.</p>
<p>Our contemporary world demands speed and practical solutions. However,
even in a hasting world, small spaces exist in which an honest person
may practice and perfect the self. In this small space, the person acts
like someone who is sharpening a knife with a grindstone. The person
takes time to make the knife sharp, patiently endure the resistance of
the grinding stone. Because of this, the knife will serve its function
better: it cuts through materials less hindered. It is with such a hope
we undertake our effort in self-completion.</p>
<p>Very often, the effort to self-completion requires solitude. Because in
our pursuit of self-completion, we will be busy with our self. A person
who undertakes the path of self-completion will be in an ongoing battle
with the weakness of the self, whatever that weakness may be. This
battle consumes time. In the process, one can be so busy with the self
that one stops to identify oneself with another person. It is always a
hard battle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="art-as-one-of-the-many-path">
<h2>Art as One of the Many Path<a class="headerlink" href="#art-as-one-of-the-many-path" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Art may serve as a path to self-completion. It serves this function in
two ways, depending on the actor who makes uses of it. From the side of
the artist, art serves self-completion by which the artist practices and
creates the art. From the side of the appreciator, art is a means to
self-reflection and catharsis.</p>
<p>One may ask whether art should serve any function at all. The author
deliberately chooses a position in this matter. So that art can be used
as a path to self-completion, art must serve a function. Both the artist
and the appreciator would develop a particular acuity to the matter,
along with their progress. The artists will curate the work that they
create; the appreciator will select the work that they appreciate.</p>
<p>Regarding the <em>function</em> of art, different cultures might place
different values on it. The author will use an example he is most
familiar with: the Javanese culture.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-knowledge-on-refine-things">
<h2>The Knowledge on Refine Things<a class="headerlink" href="#the-knowledge-on-refine-things" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the context of Javanese art, art is a means to refine a person,
making it humane. It is shown, for example, by the term <em>karawitan</em>.
The word as a whole may refer to the Javanese musical art in
general <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id79" id="id3">3</a> or the skill to cultivate and to perform a Gamelan
piece. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id80" id="id4">4</a> Palgunadi explained that the word <em>karawitan</em> comes from
the root word <em>rawit</em> that has the
meaning <em>small</em> or <em>refine</em>. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id81" id="id5">5</a> The process of realizing a musical
piece is a process of combining small and refine musical elements to
create a complex whole. In the whole process, a sensitivity to an
ultimate sense of beauty, <em>rasa</em>, is essential. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id82" id="id6">6</a></p>
<p>Art has, therefore, an educational function, and it contributes to the
development of a person. However, the way of <em>educating</em> is subtle in
comparison to an actual pedagogic method. Moreover, the subject of the
education is also a subtle one: the ultimate knowledge. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id83" id="id7">7</a> By training
one’s sensitivity to the ultimate beauty, the <em>rasa</em>, one will also be
sensitive to a higher spiritual existence, the <em>rasajati</em>.</p>
<p>In the complex of the Javanese worldview, this sensitivity to
the <em>higher truth</em> also has a consequence in social life. An ideal
society is a society in which the individual posses a particular
sensitivity to their surroundings, both nature, and human. As such, the
individual will contribute to harmony in social interaction.</p>
<p>Being an artist in such a world means that the artist must be able to
hear an inner voice: an echo of a higher power. By perfecting the
artistic skill, the artist is also perfecting the sensitivity to this
higher power. If the artist is sensitive enough, the inner voice will be
clear, and the artist will be able to hear the truth that the inner
voice speaks. The work would reflect what is spoken by the voice.</p>
<p>The audience is not free from such an experience. Since the higher truth
may speak through the art, the audience must also be sensitive so that
they understand its saying. Hence, the interaction between the inner
voice, the artist, the art, and the audience gives way to an ethical
society. We would obtain an ethical society by training
a <em>sensitive</em> society.</p>
<p>In the development of artistic skills, traditionally, professionalism is
not the primary concern. All artists, be it amateur or professional,
pursue the same goal: the perfection of the art. The perfection of the
art gives way to the completion of the self. The completion of the self
creates the sensitivity which is needed to hear the will of the higher
power.</p>
<p>In the art of karawitan, the skill of a musician is considered an honest
measure of one’s progress: whether one can realize the given piece of
music or not. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id84" id="id8">8</a> Analogously, the measure of someone’s character in
terms of the ethical life is whether one can answer the challenges in
life or not. Everyone may cultivate the musical piece according to their
current level of artistic ability and knowledge. In answering life’s
challenge in the most ethical way, it is of no difference.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="social-responsibility-of-an-artist">
<h2>Social Responsibility of an Artist<a class="headerlink" href="#social-responsibility-of-an-artist" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The artist contributes to the education of society. They carry a social
responsibility. One clear example of such responsibility in Javanese art
is the role of a Dhalang (puppet master). A puppet master serves a
function of a shaman: he or she tells not only stories, but also
philosophical discourse, ethical guidance, gives a blessing, and
performs cleansing rituals to the society. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id85" id="id9">9</a></p>
<p>In the story recited during a <em>ruwat</em> performance, a performance which
serves as a cleansing ritual, there will be a character called Dhalang
Kandha Buwana, who will perform the cleansing ritual. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id86" id="id10">10</a> People
believe that this character is a personification of the god Wisnu. Wisnu
is a god whose duty is to nurture all creation, keeping the balance of
the universe. The symbol shows the significance of art and the artist as
a patron of cosmological order.</p>
<p>By taking a position that art serves purposes, we face fewer problems
regarding the meaning of art’s existence.
Serving <em>those</em> purposes <em>is</em> the meaning of its existence. There is
no doubt why a work of art should exist. The questions are instead: what
purpose that art serves, and how well it serves this purpose.</p>
<p>Existential problems, however, are suffered by many modern artists, said
Camus. He argued that modern artists often doubt the meaning of their
work’s existence, mainly due to the environment in which art finds
itself: in the middle of the professionalism of art. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id87" id="id11">11</a> He contrasted
this doubt with those of artists in <em>older times</em>. These artists of
the past, he said, worried more about their skills in the process of
creation. Questioning the meaning of the work’s existence leads to the
inability to create freely, and the artists would suffer from having a
lest trust in itself. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id88" id="id12">12</a></p>
<p>Camus continued in his essay that art separates itself from the reality
of life by following two extremes. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id89" id="id13">13</a> The first extreme is to make
art such that it conforms to the majority of the mass, making it a
meaningless recreation. The second extreme is to pursue the fantasy of
the artist solely, making it a negation of reality.</p>
<p>One example of the first extreme is the harsh competition in the world
of entertainment nowadays. We have no lack of <em>entertaining art</em>, but
then we feel the hole of substance in what they offer.</p>
<p>One example of the second extreme is the often seemingly
“meaninglessness” of contemporary art when it presents itself outside of
the gallery or concert hall. That is: outside of its connoisseur, to a
space of the common people. It is difficult to speak of “meaning” in
such a situation. To the common people, some of the artworks simply do
not make “sense”. Art is either exclusive, incomprehensible, or of no
use for these people. “Art for art’s sake […] is indeed the artificial
art of a factitious and self-absorbed society,” said Camus. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id90" id="id14">14</a> Art
becomes disconnected from the life of common people.</p>
<p>What the middle way looks like? We may find nowadays that the border
between entertainment and art is a blur. Good art can be “entertaining”.
One example is the Wayang performance. A person who watches a Wayang
performance may enjoy its philosophical contents, as well as its
entertaining elements. Whoever experienced a live Wayang performance
would remember the virtuoso display of puppet playing during battle
scenes, the comedy, the entertaining music, dance performance, as well
as the social gatherings which take place there. At the same time, a
Wayang performance comes from a tradition of shamanic ritual.</p>
<p>In general, a Wayang performance <em>serves a function</em> and, therefore,
must carry <em>values</em>. Because of these, the Wayang performance survives
among the common people as an art form. It has a balance between its
intrinsic values and its entertaining element. Camus offers an
intriguing insight in regards to this. He said, in order for art to be
able to speak to everyone, it must speak about things that everyone
knows, and it must speak about the reality that we all share. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id91" id="id15">15</a> Are
not we all share the triumph and the tragedy of a human’s life?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-case-of-the-wayang">
<h2>The Case of the Wayang<a class="headerlink" href="#the-case-of-the-wayang" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The often-used story in a Wayang performance comes from the Mahabharata
epic, especially the Javanese version. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id92" id="id16">16</a> This story is the most
popular among any epic used in a Wayang performance. Why is this story
so popular? It is because it speaks to and about <em>us</em>.</p>
<p>Magnis-Suseno explained that a Wayang performance is so close to the
people because it displays models for problems in human existence on one
side, and refrain from giving a final answer to these problems on the
other side. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id93" id="id17">17</a> Alternatively, as a paraphrase to Camus’, Wayang
speaks to the people about things which everyone knows: the complexity
of human existence. The stories in Bharatayuda are stories of humanity’s
struggle in the face of their suffering, as well as their struggle to
attain self-completion. The character in the stories was always facing
the dilemma of making a decision. In order to make a decision, the
character has to be clear about their responsibility and divine task.</p>
<p>Moreover, it must correspond to their current reality. Analogous to what
the character faces, the human must discover for themselves what their
duty is. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id94" id="id18">18</a>`  &lt;#sdfootnote19sym&gt;`__One of the central motifs in a
wayang story is the problem of choice. In Bharatayudha, two families who
share a common ancestor have to face each other in a war. Like every
war, one has to choose a side. If the opponent is an evil stranger, the
problem might be less problematic. However, knowing that the people on
the other side are either relatives or friends, no matter which side we
choose, we face a difficult choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="arjuna-and-the-problem-of-choice">
<h2>Arjuna and the Problem of Choice<a class="headerlink" href="#arjuna-and-the-problem-of-choice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A famous episode from Bharatayuda is the story of Arjuna, who refused to
take on his weapon on the last seconds leading to the war. Falling
helplessly, his charioteer Prabu Kresna revealed not only consoling
words but also the highest form of knowledge in spirituality.</p>
<p>The conversation between Prabu Kresna and Arjuna constitutes an episode
within Bharatayuda under the name Bhagavad Gita. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id95" id="id19">19</a> In order to
console Arjuna and to motivate him to carry his duty, Kresna revealed to
Arjuna the teaching of the <em>Karma Yoga</em>. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id96" id="id20">20</a> In this teaching, one’s
action can be a path to enlightenment. However, it cannot just be an
arbitrary action. It must be a selfless and pure action. This kind of
action leads to enlightenment. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id97" id="id21">21</a></p>
<p>What is then a selfless and pure action? A pure action that Kresna means
is an action that one does without expecting the fruits of the
action. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id98" id="id22">22</a> This practice is meaningful so that one realizes that the
“actor” of that action is not the “self”, but rather something of a
higher and “divine” nature. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id99" id="id23">23</a></p>
<p>To achieve this type of action, one has to train. The path of training
is by doing one’s duty <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id100" id="id24">24</a> and be responsible for it. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id101" id="id25">25</a> With this,
Kresna tried to motivate Arjuna to take his weapon and fulfill his duty
as a warrior. He must bear the pain of killing his relatives and friends
who stood on the other side.</p>
<p>In the story of Arjuna, he finally chose to go to war because he was
convinced and consoled by the teaching of Kresna: to perform his duty as
a warrior. However, in the epic of Ramayana, two giants from the side of
Rahwana (the epic’s antagonist character) chose two different paths in
regards to “performing one’s duty”. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id102" id="id26">26</a> Kumbakarna the giant chose to
switch side into prince Rama’s army (the epic’s protagonist) because he
thought a warrior has to side with the righteous one, i.e., prince Rama.
However, Kumbakarna, the giant chose to stay due to reason similar to
Arjuna: a warrior’s duty is to fight for the land he serves. Here we see
two different choices in interpreting “one’s duty.” Traditionally,
people consider that both giants are making the <em>right choice</em>, each
to his own.</p>
<p>Like a playful joke, Kierkegaard presented us what he called the essence
of practical philosophy: the problem of either/or. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id103" id="id27">27</a> He illustrates
how a person who marries a girl will regret it, but he will also regret
it if he does not marry her. So, either he marries the girl or not, he
will regret it. One may argue that this <em>joke</em> is to say that our
choice does not matter in the end. However, is <em>the end</em> the only
consideration in the complexity of making a choice?</p>
<p>One can solve the problem of choice by choosing. So this riddle, to say
that we take the joke more seriously, can be solved by
choosing <em>either</em> of the choices. Even when both of the choices lead
to regret, it will be two different experiences: one is married to a
woman, or one is not. Marrying someone might mean more responsibilities
in life and putting some constraint into one’s ego. Nevertheless, it
also promises the possibility of a different kind of experience that one
yet to know. Because one does not know it yet, it might be a <em>pleasant
surprise</em>.</p>
<p>Life is more complicated than the binary opposition that the riddle
poses. Very often, we have more than just two choices. Even when it
does, choosing one answer does not necessarily make the one or the other
choice <em>wrong</em>. The situation is well exemplified by the story of
Kumbakarna and Wibisana, whereas the two warrior starts with a similar
view on duty, but ends up taking the two different sides. It is
challenging to judge which one is <em>right</em> and which one is <em>wrong</em>.
Also, if the riddle starts as a joke, then why not consider the
possibility that one can be <em>either</em> married and happy <em>or</em> one is
not married and—still—happy!</p>
<p>Then, concerning Camus’ appeal and the teaching exposed by Kresna, what
is it then the duty of the artist? Specifically, related to the above
discussion before: what is the duty of the artist to the society?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hints-of-duty-to-the-society">
<h2>Hints of Duty to the Society<a class="headerlink" href="#hints-of-duty-to-the-society" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Following the method of the Wayang stories, let us observes some models
of some poet’s life and works. Instead of finding “the final answer”,
they shall give us hints regarding the type of duty an artist has to the
society.</p>
<p>Wiji Thukul’s <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id104" id="id28">28</a> life and work embody a sense of duty. An artist
should have social solidarity, he said. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id105" id="id29">29</a> In a country like
Indonesia, social responsibility is of importance due to the big divide
between socioeconomic classes. In a situation where government programs
often felt to be ineffective, people have to take care of themselves.
The artists are <em>among</em> the people. Hence, to Thukul, an artist has a
responsibility to the people.</p>
<p>Literature, he further said, has political power. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id106" id="id30">30</a> This
consciousness of such a power shows that an artist can contribute to the
life of society. Even though an artist does not affect political
decisions directly, the latent political power of their work may move
the people. In the case of Indonesian history, Thukul explained that
since the Dutch colonial era, to the Japan occupation, and the new order
government of Indonesia, there will always be an <em>underground
literature</em>, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id107" id="id31">31</a> which moved outside the official area and rose to
challenge the dominating power. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id108" id="id32">32</a></p>
<p>To Thukul, art must live where the artist lives. It is through the daily
life of an artist that art takes its form. There is no division between
art and life: the life of the artist is the work. Hence, a poet must
possess a free and active soul so that one seeks truth through freedom,
actively questioning the <em>truth</em>, and finds oneself always in the
middle of a learning process. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id109" id="id33">33</a> During the creation of a poem, the
poet relies only on their self. The process requires a particular
sensitivity. Because they must be self-reliant, the artist must fight
for their aspirations. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id110" id="id34">34</a> The art, according to him, is a medium to
convey the problem of the underprivileged. However, Thukul seems to see
himself in that matter as an anti-hero:</p>
<p>To straight things up, I do not defend the people. In actuality, I am
only defending myself. […] It just happens that by defending myself, I
speak the rights of others who, at the time being, find no place. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id111" id="id35">35</a></p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>I am not a protesting poet. I am aware of a process [in life]. The
problems in the poem revert to my personal problems. […] After I drop
out of school, at that moment, I realized the true meaning of
life. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id112" id="id36">36</a></p>
<p>Despite this clarity of duty, Thukul still faces an inner struggle: the
struggle between his sense of duty as a poet and the corresponding
existential crisis. <em>The Poet</em>`  &lt;#sdfootnote38sym&gt;`__is a
declaration of his identity and sense of duty: to write.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">If no typewriter is available</div>
<div class="line">With my hand, I shall write</div>
<div class="line">If no black ink is available</div>
<div class="line">With charcoals, I shall write</div>
<div class="line">If no paper is available</div>
<div class="line">On the wall, I shall write</div>
<div class="line">If from writing I am forbid</div>
<div class="line">With drops of blood</div>
<div class="line">I shall write! <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id113" id="id37">37</a></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>On the other side, in <em>What is Worthy of My Poems</em>, his existential
struggle is apparent:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">What is worthy of my poems?</div>
<div class="line">[…]</div>
<div class="line">If we ought to eat</div>
<div class="line">but there is nothing there to eat</div>
<div class="line">[…]</div>
<div class="line">What I wrote took months</div>
<div class="line">What can I give amid the poverty</div>
<div class="line">that strangles us?</div>

</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Thukul’s reality is poverty, social injustice, and political oppression.
His artistic output is inseparable from this reality. Therefore,
acknowledging his <em>duty</em>, the poet had chosen to fulfill his duty as a
householder by other means than art while using poetry to speaks for the
underprivileged. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id115" id="id39">39</a> Wiji Thukul is never to be found until today,
carrying the duty that he chose. In the middle of all kinds of
oppression, he decided that “there is only one word: resist!” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id116" id="id40">40</a></p>
<p>The poet Rendra expressed a similar sense of duty. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id117" id="id41">41</a> His poetry
often criticizes the Indonesian New Order government. When asked why he
was so brave to direct such critics to the government, he said that he
was critical to them not because of his bravery, but rather “out of fear
for what will befall my descendants in the future.” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id118" id="id42">42</a> In one phase
of his creativity, he even labeled his poetry as “emergency
pamphlets,”  <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id119" id="id43">43</a> to show his utmost concern to the social problem in
Indonesia.</p>
<p>If Thukul’s poetry is a call to arm and the voice of the suppressed,
Rendra’s are the general’s order and the prophet’s divination:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Stop looking for the Just King! <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id120" id="id44">44</a></div>
<div class="line">The Just King is non-existent.</div>
<div class="line">The Just King is a mere diversion!</div>
<div class="line">What we should uphold together</div>
<div class="line">is the Just Law</div>
<div class="line">The Just Law is the guiding star within the storm. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id121" id="id45">45</a></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Rendra, putting himself in the middle of the <em>storm</em>, answered his
existential struggle. Humans, the universe, and the human’s act are
inseparable elements in which connection is essential to be understood.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">There exists, indeed, human sovereignty, little Na.</div>
<div class="line">But long before that</div>
<div class="line">exists the universe sovereignty.</div>
<div class="line">[…]</div>
<div class="line">Without realizing this</div>

<div class="line">The life and all of the human’s effort</div>

<div class="line">only when human realize the limit of their ability. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id122" id="id46">46</a></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>To Rendra, one should face the reality of life’s suffering <em>as it is</em>,
fully fronted. Without <em>waiting</em> and <em>looking</em> somewhere else, Rendra
appeals to his reader to participate actively in life. So active, that
one finally reached what is possible to realize: the realization of
one’s limit. However, one cannot just realize this through words or
merely understand it through the faculty. It is attained only through
action. The most important of all action is the training of the most
profound conscience. “Art is what makes human, humane,” so is the common
credo in the circle of the Indonesian traditional artists. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id123" id="id47">47</a></p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And human will not be human</div>

<div class="line">With this poem I bear witness</div>
<div class="line">that even when that conscience</div>

</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Rendra’s appeal is compelling because it appeals not only to the
awakening of the most profound human conscience but also because the
medium of his appeal is his <em>poetry</em>. One’s best way of contributing
to the universe, according to Rendra, is by knowing one’s <em>duty</em> and
contribute accordingly. The <em>duty</em> of the poet is to write poetry,
even when the poet himself felt that he was in no condition to write.</p>

<div class="section" id="training-for-clarity">
<h2>Training for Clarity<a class="headerlink" href="#training-for-clarity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As symbolized in the episode of <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>, selfless action is
the path of self-completion. Its training involves the ability to act.
However, the teaching of the <em>Gita</em> puts restrain on the type of
action that counts. We might ask, what kind of action then that artists
and the audience should be involved with, so that <em>it counts</em>?</p>
<p>Rendra started with sharp criticism to fellow artists and academician in
the poem <em>A Cigar’s Poem</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I have asked</div>
<div class="line">but my questions</div>
<div class="line">collided against the foreheads of salon poets</div>
<div class="line">who make poetry about wine and the moon,</div>
<div class="line">while injustice took place beside them</div>
<div class="line">and eight million children without education</div>
<div class="line">stunned by the feet of the Goddess of Art <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id126" id="id50">50</a></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The <em>salon poets</em> are portrayed as ignorant artists because their
subject of work does not have any relation to the <em>injustice</em> and
educational problem that existent in their society. Thukul said that
those are the attitude of the Indonesian artist (supposedly in his
time). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id127" id="id51">51</a> Art should live where the artist lives, recording what
takes place in its surrounding. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id128" id="id52">52</a></p>
<p>The Goddess of Art is worthy of our attention in this poetry. While she
is a goddess with supposedly has power over humans, she is helpless in
the face of “eight million children without education.” Is Rendra tried
to show that the goddess is, after all, limited to a certain degree?
That art, without the proper context, would render helpless when it
faces reality?</p>
<p>Horace, in his <em>Ars Poetica</em>, advised that a poet should balance two
polarities in a poem: the need to delight and instruct. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id129" id="id53">53</a> To delight
means to fulfill the aesthetic quality of a work, which an artist would
aim in the first place. However, to instruct requires something else: a
consideration of <em>ethical</em> <em>value</em>. Horace said a poet would like to
say something which is both delightful and beneficial for life. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id130" id="id54">54</a> Is
there merit to attain such a goal? At least during the time of Horace,
the balance of delight and instruction provides the poet with a broader
public appreciation. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id131" id="id55">55</a> This seems in line with what Camus said about
art that is able to speak to many.</p>
<p>Moreover, Horace gave another recommendation on how to achieve the
mentioned purpose at best. Regarding giving instruction, he recommended
that the instruction should be brief because then it is easier to be
understood: “everything superfluous flows out of a full mind.” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id132" id="id56">56</a> The
usage of superfluous language does not promote understanding. We could
find resonance in Wiji Thukul’s experience with his colleagues: fellow
paint workers. He found that when he took his colleagues to a play, they
could not follow it because of its <em>difficulty</em>. He became unable to
discuss it with them. Therefore, he shaped his language so that it is
understandable by most people. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id133" id="id57">57</a></p>
<p>Given that <em>ars</em> means “craft,” it demands training. To express
oneself, so that others understand, requires training. Often, the
complexity of expression is also caused by training, albeit the
incorrect ones.</p>
<p>Regarding this simplicity of expression, it is interesting to take a
detour into the commentary of academic writing by Popper in his
essay <em>Wider die großen Worte</em>, where, according to him, students are
trained in the wrong mindset and follow the wrong examples. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id134" id="id58">58</a></p>
<p>In academic writing (and other written <em>intellectual</em> output), Popper
criticizes the usage of difficult language over the simple one. He
proposes that not to use complicated words if their usage does not
contribute to understanding the content of the writing. Popper starts
with the ground reasoning of using simple words instead of the big ones:
because every intellectual has a responsibility to the society.</p>
<p>To Popper, intellectuals have a privilege over most people in society:
they had the opportunity to study. Because they studied, they have a
responsibility to society to report their research and their result of
study to the public. When they speak, however, they must be understood,
presenting themselves in the clearest way possible, and—above all—in
humbleness. That is why Popper condemned intellectuals who used big
words just to amaze. In his essay in <em>die Zeit</em>, he even went to
“translate” citations from Habermas and Adorno into more accessible
language.</p>
<p>For Popper, those who cannot say something clearly should either be
silent or continue to work until clarity in saying can be achieved. If
there is one ethical guideline that one can follow, it is given by
Popper in one interview. During the closing of a congress of philosophy
in Wien (1968), Popper needed to answer, in <em>one sentence,</em> the
question, “What is the most urgent thing to do?” Popper was the only one
answering briefly among other philosophers. He answered, “To have some
more intellectual humbleness.” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id135" id="id59">59</a></p>
<p>Mills, in his advice for students, warned of the same thing. He, like
Popper, appeal for intellectual humbleness. What he afraid of was the
fact that the source of superfluous language of <em>academic prose *is
what he called *an academic pose</em>, hence his appeal: “To overcome
academic prose, you have to overcome academic pose.” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id136" id="id60">60</a> His advice
for students, interestingly, entitled <em>On Intellectual Craftsmanship</em>.
Again, an echo of the word <em>ars</em>: a craft that requires training. The
most beneficial training demands humbleness from the trainees: they must
admit the limit of their ability.</p>
<p>Let us return to the second aspect of poetry, as Horace explained. When
to delight is the goal, Horace continued, a work of fiction should be
close to reality so that the work should not ask for belief in whatever
topic it chooses. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id137" id="id61">61</a> Here, we find again what Thukul and Camus
appealed, that art should not be cut apart from the reality of its
society.</p>
<p>One may ask then, “But is it not fantasy a part of it? That art can and
should provide what reality cannot?” The author’s answer would be: yes,
indeed. Art can refute reality or depart from it.</p>
<p>The reality that Camus talked about is not <em>realism</em>. To Camus, if the
goal is to capture life in its entirety, it would require an invisible
camera that captures life everywhere in every moment. What the camera
captured should project itself to a grand universal screen. Hence, only
God is the true artist who is capable of such a feat, while other
artists cannot be sufficiently faithful to reality. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id138" id="id62">62</a> The most
significant work is always a combined force that creates an equilibrium
between reality and its refusal. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id139" id="id63">63</a></p>
<p>Since poetry is also considered a craft, Horace emphasized the
importance of training to accompany talent:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Whether a praiseworthy poem is due to nature</div>
<div class="line">Or art is the question: I’ve never seen the benefit</div>
<div class="line">Of study lacking a wealth of talent, or of untrained</div>
<div class="line">Ability: each needs the other’s friendly assistance. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id140" id="id64">64</a></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, one reaches self-completion through action: the process of
self-training. The training process means a deliberate step outside of
one’s comfort. In Horace’s word, whoever strives for a goal must be
ready to suffer, sweat, freeze, and abstain from “wine and
woman”. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id141" id="id65">65</a> Those who have chosen greatness must then come to it with
the best of effort, leaving most things and postpones others, so
Epictetus. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id142" id="id66">66</a> Concentration supports the path to self-completion, as
well as the sorting of priority.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="didactic-poem-the-javanese-tembang">
<h2>Didactic Poem: the Javanese Tembang<a class="headerlink" href="#didactic-poem-the-javanese-tembang" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some of the well-known Javanese tembang <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id143" id="id67">67</a> are didactic poems. The
poem is giving life guidance. It can be recited as a solo performance,
for one’s solitary enjoyment, or accompanied by a gamelan ensemble. As a
teaching material (piwulang), however, the song-poems are commonly be
sung from parents to their children as a lullaby. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id144" id="id68">68</a> One of the most
popular tembang with the teaching of spirituality and ethic is the Serat
Wedhatama, supposedly composed by the king Mangkunegara IV of Surakarta
and published in 1927. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id145" id="id69">69</a></p>
<p>The path to self-completion, according to the teaching of Wedhatama,
starts with self-isolation. Like the simile used in Horace and
Epictetus, one should leave some of the comforts of life in order to
achieve a higher goal. It is the first step necessary on the path of
self-completion.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">When one is on a journey, away from home</div>
<div class="line">on a trip to places of silence</div>
<div class="line">breath the divinity of knowledge</div>
<div class="line">so that the true destination becomes clear</div>
<div class="line">may the heart be steadfast</div>
<div class="line">to make use the deepest of conscience</div>
<div class="line">contemplating on the purest compassion</div>
<div class="line">by the edge of the ocean</div>
<div class="line">through focused meditation, achieving enlightenment <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id146" id="id70">70</a></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The element of silence is essential, for this signifies the elimination
of distraction. In Javanese philosophy, eliminating distraction by
self-isolation also has the goal of isolating oneself from sensual
passion. In the <em>Fire Sermon</em> Sutra, Buddha compares the sensual
passion and desires to the fire, which burns it. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id147" id="id71">71</a> The burning of
sensual passion and evil intentions causes human suffering, and this
fire can be put off through understanding: to train equanimity to it, to
let passion cease, and finally attaining liberation from it. To go “on a
trip to places of silence” is one way to practice the equanimity and the
cease of sensual passion.</p>
<p>The teaching of Wedhatama centers on attaining the character of the
paragon human (janma utama). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id148" id="id72">72</a> The paragon human contributes to
society on the one hand, while perfecting their self on the other hand.
Different to a stereotypical hermit who lives entirely outside of the
society, the <em>janma utama</em> still perform their “knightly” duty to the
society.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">So are the paragon ones</div>
<div class="line">ones who sink themselves in solitude</div>
<div class="line">ones who sharpen and cleanse their conscience</div>
<div class="line">ones who fulfill their duties as knights</div>
<div class="line">upholding moral orders</div>
<div class="line">artful in consoling the society</div>
<div class="line">so it is a religious life <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id149" id="id73">73</a></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>What is the goal of such a practice? Why sets of rigid rules and almost
unattainable of human character? In Wedhatama, it is to obtain the
divine, true knowledge. In Wedthatama, Mangkunegara IV said of
the <em>nature</em> of this knowledge:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">So is the true knowledge</div>
<div class="line">It is truly consoling the heart <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id150" id="id74">74</a></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The goal is to obtain the knowledge that <em>consoles</em> the heart. One
walks the path to overcome human suffering.</p>
<p>The artist, as humans, creates their work, be it as a revelation borne
out of talents or results of self-completion through training.
Nevertheless, most important of all: artists are human beings. The work
is an expression of their humanity. The perfection of the work comes
from the perfection of the human, and <em>vice versa</em>, through perfecting
their work, they are perfecting themselves.</p>
<p>In reaching self-completion, a human is equipped by its nature: its
talent, its genius, its physical form, and abilities. And also: its
destiny. To walk on the path of one’s destiny is to put all these nature
to use consciously. Tools are only useful when they are put into work:
when they are used to overcome problems and difficulties. Afterward, one
could ask, what is then one’s nature? Can one then be fully conscious of
this nature? It is to find this inner truth that the old Emerson appeal
to: “To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you
in your private heart is true for all men […].” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id151" id="id75">75</a> Art gives humans a
mirror with which they can see themselves to recognize these natures.</p>
<p>The path of self-completion is a path of becoming. Every genuine
transformation takes time. Between the current point in which humans
find themselves and the point where they would like to become, lies an
unknown territory. The meeting points of human effort and the
predestined terrains are what we label human’s destiny. To recognize
one’s duty, to be aware of the relationship of one’s work and one’s
environment, to train oneself until the limit of what is possible: that
is part of human effort. In the face of the predestined terrains, one
makes use of its best ability: the ability to choose.</p>
<p>Let us close this long reflection with a recitation of the <em>Mantra
Manyura</em>, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id152" id="id76">76</a> so that our path to self-completion be blessed and
attained:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">O, this servant wishes to recite <em>Mantra Manyura</em></div>
<div class="line">which form is a blur, almost invisible</div>
<div class="line">whose sound is faint, at nights</div>
<div class="line">so faint, carried by the winds</div>
<div class="line">O, it sneaks into the heart</div>
<div class="line">a mantra beautifully decorated</div>
<div class="line">nevermore the clearness of the soul be haze</div>
<div class="line">the soul is enlightened, at times of silence</div>
<div class="line">O, in between being asleep and awake</div>
<div class="line">Dearest Lord, the servant’s divine amulet</div>
<div class="line">Only this what the servant asks:</div>
<div class="line">bless it to become what it seeks to become</div>

“janma utama” is “superior man”. To the author, this reminds him of
Nietzsche’s “Übermensch” (the author’s preferred translation:
Adimanusia). In Nietzsche’s conception, the Adimanusia is a new kind
of humanity, who underwent “re-evaluation of all values” and went
“beyond good and evil.”</p>
