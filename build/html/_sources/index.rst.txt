Adicita: an Attempt of Understanding
====================================


About This Pages
----------------

Adicita is an archaic Indonesian word. According to the official grand
dictionary of Indonesian language, this word means *ideology*. It seems to me
that it was an attempt to find a proper Indonesian translation of a foreign
concept, while looking at existing words in the culture. This word, if one
simply translates it freely, can also be mean *great ideas*. In any way,
understanding the meaning of the word is always an attempt.

Here one can read a work in progress. I planned it to be a collection of
personal essays. It is personal because in the beginning, it is something
I wrote only for myself and distributed to small circle of friends. The
essays start from a problem: real life problem which either me or one of my
friends experienced. From there, I *attempt* to understand the problem and 
to look for consolation. It is, in a way, a game of following a personal muse.

Therefore, I asked for your patient, dear readers. This essays are by no
means able to answer *big questions*. They are also incomplete, and do not
represent a *state-of-the-art* of the problem. However, I hope that they have
the same consoling effect to you, and arouse your imaginations. Sometimes,
consolation and imagination are path to hope. Hope is a free resource that
is readily available in our deepest heart, if one knows how to find and light
it.

I wish you, dear reader, an enjoyable reading. I hope that we are all free
from suffering and find happiness.
