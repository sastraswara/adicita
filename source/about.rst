The Author

I am Sastraswara, the author of these essays. Thank you for coming.
Probably you have read or skim some of the materials here. I hope that
you find something for yourself.

If you find to give a commentary to what you read, feel free to write me 
an `email`_. This can range from criticism, suggestions, ideas, *et cetera*.
I will answer as soon as I am able.

This is one of many personal projects I am working on. Throughout my life,
I realized that I have benefited from a lot of things.
I see my works as a way for me to contribute back to society and to life.
You are welcome to see my other works, starting from my `front page`_.
